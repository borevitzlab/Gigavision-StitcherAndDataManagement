#	
# Function: The primary script in the Automated Stitching System.  Upates all projects (each resolution as well) by
#           Makeing calles to update the image and gigapan for the last two months as well as stitching image sets wh appropriate.
#
# Operations: Mount the EEG server to the local computer.
#             Call on IMGDBprogram.sh to update the last two months of the image database
#             Remove zombie RESname_STITCHING_PID.txt files
#             Query the image databse for unstitched image sets
#             Compare current unstitched queue list with active stitching queue list
#             Generate new queue list for stitching if new unique image sets exist
#             Check the number image sets currently begin processed
#             Check if number of stitching processing units is below allocated amount
#             Call STATUSprogram.sh to update the stitching status on the local computer
#             Call GigaPan applicaiton to stitch image set if below allocated processing amount
#             Call GIGADBprogram.sh to update gigapan database if image stitched succesfully
#             Call STATUSprogram.sh to update the stitching status on the local computer
#             Unmount the EEG server if there is no other Autostitcher shells are running
#             
# Called By: 	CRON job.
# Calls: 	IMGDBprogram.sh STATUSprogram.sh GIGADBprogram.sh
#
# Important Environment Variables:
# USER - The user name for logging onto EEG
# PASS - The password associated with the USER
# PATH - Deafult varible used by shell to search for functions
# PROJECTFLDR - The complete path on EEG where projects are saved
# MOUNTFLDR - The complete path that the shell should use to mount EEG
# GIGAVISION - The complete path to the Gigavision program suite
# IFS (Internal Field Sperators) - Shell default variable used to delineate lists
# OLD_ifs - Used to store the deafult IFS before changing them.  Usefully if you want to change them back in the same shell
# RESname - The name of prj plus the resolution. For example, it could be BigBlowoutEast or BigBlowoutEastSmall depending on resolution
# prj

# QUESTIONS
# WHat is $ and $$ by themselves??
# $ signifies a enviromental variable and $$ is the PID (Processor ID) for the current shell.
## I used this in order to make each file unique when makeing temporary files
